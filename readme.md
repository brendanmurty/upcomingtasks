UpcomingTasks

## About

[UpcomingTasks](https://upcomingtasks.com) is a free web-based [Basecamp 2](https://basecamp.com/) client I created to easily manage tasks on smaller devices.

Users also have the option to upgrade to a Pro account which unlocks [additional features](https://upcomingtasks.com/pages/pro.php).

It was created in [Sublime Text](http://www.sublimetext.com/) using the [Basecamp API](https://github.com/basecamp/bcx-api) and hosted by [Digital Ocean](http://digitalocean.com).

## Why

I was inspired by [Brad Frost](https://github.com/bradfrost)'s [TED talk](https://twitter.com/brad_frost/status/476515058738925568) about being open by default. If you haven't seen this talk yet, I'd recommend investing half an hour to [watch the video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7rW9vTrN6OU) and read the [blog post](http://bradfrostweb.com/blog/post/creative-exhaust/).

As I'm self-taught, engaging with the [community](https://twitter.com/brendanmurty/lists/web-design/members), [listening to inspirational people](http://boagworld.com/show) and [reading about new techniques](https://signalvnoise.com/programming) helped me turn my passion in to my career.

I hope an aspiring web developer can learn something new from what I've done here and start their own career. Hopefully I can give back to the community that has taught me so much over the last few years.
