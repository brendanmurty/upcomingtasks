UpcomingTasks

## About ##

[UpcomingTasks](http://upcomingtasks.com) is a free web-based [Basecamp](https://basecamp.com/) client I created in some [spare time](http://www.solutionsoutsourced.com.au/blog/n/tinker-time-produces-a-new-app-upcomingtasks-121017) to easily manage tasks on smaller devices.

It was created in [Sublime Text](http://www.sublimetext.com) using the [Basecamp API](https://github.com/basecamp/bcx-api) and hosted by [Digital Ocean](http://digitalocean.com).

## Why ##

I was inspired by [Brad Frost](https://github.com/bradfrost)'s [TED talk](https://twitter.com/brad_frost/status/476515058738925568) about being open by default. If you haven't seen this talk yet, I'd recommend investing half an hour to [watch the video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7rW9vTrN6OU) and read the [blog post](http://bradfrostweb.com/blog/post/creative-exhaust/).

As I'm self-taught, engaging with the [community](https://twitter.com/brendanmurty/lists/web-design/members), [listening to inspirational people](http://boagworld.com/show) and [reading about new techniques](https://signalvnoise.com/programming) helped me turn my passion in to my career.

I hope a budding web developer can learn something new from what I've done here and start their own career. Hopefully I can give back to the community that has taught me so much over the last few years.
